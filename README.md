# MiCM Intro to Bayesian Inference

In this 4-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to the fundamentals behind Bayesian inference. Participants will learn how to define a prior distribution and will learn to appreciate how the choice of a prior and the sampled observations can influence the inferred posterior distribution. The workshop will also cover different approaches for approximating the posterior and showcase examples of how the implementation of prior distributions can assist modeling tasks (linear regression, GLMs, DESeq2, etc.). All material will be complemented with implementations and exercises in R.

 

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

Understand what prior and likelihood distributions are and how they influence the posterior.
Understand the advantage of using conjugate distributions when designing a model.
Acquire knowledge on different techniques for approximating intractable posteriors.
How to implement the presented material in R
 

Prerequisites:
Previous experience with R
Previous experience with Probability & Statistics
Calculus I & II (MATH140/MATH141)
